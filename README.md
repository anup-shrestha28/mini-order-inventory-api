# Mini Order & Inventory API

A backend service for a small e-commerce operation that manages **products, users, and orders**, with a deliberate focus on **concurrency-safe stock management in MongoDB** — an order can **never oversell stock**, even under simultaneous requests.

Built with **Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB (Mongoose)** and fully containerized: one command brings up the API and its database.

> **Status:** 🚧 In active development. Progress is tracked in [Requirement Coverage](#requirement-coverage).

---

## Quick Start (for reviewers)

**Only requirement: Docker + Docker Compose.** No local Node.js, MongoDB install, or Atlas account needed.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mini-order-inventory-api
cp .env.example .env          # the only manual step — defaults work as-is
docker compose up --build     # builds the API and starts it together with MongoDB
```

Once it's running:

| What          | Where                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API base      | `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`                                                         |
| Health check  | `http://localhost:3000/health` → `{"success":true,"data":{"status":"ok","db":"connected"}}` |

**Inspect the stored data** (no extra tools needed — opens a Mongo shell inside the container):

```bash
docker exec -it moi_mongo mongosh
#   use mini_order_inventory
#   show collections
#   db.products.find().pretty()
```

Or connect **MongoDB Compass** to `mongodb://localhost:27017/?directConnection=true` (the `directConnection=true` is required because Mongo runs as a replica set).

**Run the automated test suite** (needs Node 20+; runs *without* Docker, using an in-memory MongoDB):

```bash
npm install && npm test
```

**Stop / reset:**

```bash
docker compose down       # stop the stack (stored data is preserved)
docker compose down -v    # stop and wipe all stored data
```

> **Trying the API** (signup → login → create product → place order) and the **pre-seeded admin test account** are documented under [API Documentation](#api-documentation) and [Test Accounts](#test-accounts) — populated as those endpoints are built in the next phases.

## Overview

Admins manage a product catalog with stock levels; customers place orders against that catalog. The system's defining requirement is correctness under concurrency: because MongoDB does not provide relational-style transactions by default, the approach to atomic stock updates is explicit and deliberate (see [Concurrency & Data-Modeling Design](#concurrency--data-modeling-design)).

## Features

- **JWT authentication** (signup / login) with hashed passwords
- **Role-based access control** (`admin` / `customer`) enforced via middleware
- **Product catalog CRUD** (admin-only writes) with **model-level validation**
- **Concurrency-safe order creation** — atomically validates and decrements stock
- **Pagination + filtering** on list endpoints
- **Consistent, structured error responses**; schema-based request validation (Zod)
- **Security hardening** — helmet, cors, NoSQL-injection sanitization, rate limiting
- **Automated tests**, including a **concurrency / race-condition** test
- **Dockerfile + docker-compose** (app + MongoDB) with **env-based config**
- **Structured logging** (pino) and a **`/health`** endpoint

> **Stack note:** we use **Mongoose** over the native driver for its model-level validation (a requirement) and clean session/transaction API. We use **bcryptjs** rather than native `bcrypt` to keep the container build dependency-free and reliable.

## Architecture

Clean, layered separation of concerns — each layer has one job and is independently testable. Business logic (including the atomic stock/order core) lives in **services**, never in route handlers.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** — for Option A (nothing else needed).
- **Node.js 20+** and **npm** — for Option B and for running the test suite locally.
- A free **MongoDB Atlas** account — only for Option B.

## Getting Started

### Option A — Docker (recommended for reviewers)

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # defaults work out of the box
docker compose up --build
```

- API base: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
- Health: `http://localhost:3000/health`

Compose starts a MongoDB single-node **replica set** and the API together, with the API waiting until Mongo is healthy. No manual steps beyond copying `.env.example` to `.env`.

### Option B — Local with MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster (see the step-by-step below / ask the maintainer).
2. `cp .env.example .env`, then set `MONGO_URI` to your Atlas connection string.
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` — hot-reload dev server (TypeScript via `tsx`).

For a production-style local run: `npm run build && npm start` (compiles to `dist/`, then runs the compiled JS). Type-check without emitting: `npm run typecheck`.

> **MongoDB Atlas setup (summary):** create a free **M0** cluster → add a **database user** → allow your IP under **Network Access** → **Connect → Drivers** → copy the `mongodb+srv://…` string → paste into `.env` as `MONGO_URI` (append the DB name `mini_order_inventory`). Atlas clusters are replica sets, so transactions work out of the box.

## Environment Variables

All configuration is via environment variables (never hard-coded). See `.env.example`.

| Variable               | Required | Default                         | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`             | no       | `development`                   | `development` \| `test` \| `production`      |
| `PORT`                 | no       | `3000`                          | HTTP port                                    |
| `MONGO_URI`            | **yes**  | —                               | MongoDB connection string                    |
| `JWT_SECRET`           | **yes**  | —                               | Secret used to sign JWTs                     |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`       | no       | `1d`                            | Token lifetime                               |
| `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS`   | no       | `10`                            | bcrypt cost factor                           |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | no       | `900000`                        | Rate-limit window (ms)                       |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`       | no       | `100`                           | Max requests per window per IP               |

## API Documentation

Base URL: `/api/v1`. The full endpoint table plus copy-paste **example requests** (curl) for each flow — signup → login → create product (admin) → place order → list orders — are added here as the endpoints land (see [Requirement Coverage](#requirement-coverage)).

| Method | Endpoint             | Auth      | Description                                   |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`            | public    | Liveness + DB connection status               |
| GET    | `/api/v1`            | public    | API metadata                                  |
| _…auth, products, orders endpoints documented as implemented…_ | | | |

### Test Accounts

- **Sign up** (`POST /api/v1/auth/signup`) creates a **customer** by default — self-registering as an admin is intentionally *not* allowed (that would defeat role-based access control).
- To exercise **admin-only** endpoints, the project ships a small, idempotent **seed script** (`npm run seed`, or `docker compose exec app npm run seed`) that creates a documented admin account (credentials configurable via `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars, with sensible defaults printed on run) plus a few sample products, so a reviewer can log in as admin immediately.

> _The seed script and its documented credentials are delivered in the authentication/product phases; this section records the intended, reviewer-friendly approach._

## Concurrency & Data-Modeling Design

**The problem.** Multiple customers may order the same product at the same instant. A naïve "read stock → check → write" is a race: two requests both read `stock = 1`, both pass the check, both write, and the product oversells. MongoDB gives no relational-style transaction by default, so atomicity must be explicit.

**Our approach — a conditional atomic update, inside a transaction.** We combine two mechanisms:

1. **Conditional atomic update as the oversell guard.** For each product we run:

   ```js
   Product.findOneAndUpdate(
     { _id: productId, stock: { $gte: qty } }, // only match if enough stock
     { $inc: { stock: -qty } },                // decrement atomically
     { new: true, session }
   );
   ```

   The match and the decrement are a **single atomic document operation**. If two requests race, MongoDB serializes them at the document level; the one that would drive stock negative simply **doesn't match** the filter (returns `null`) and never decrements. This alone prevents overselling for a single product — lock-free.

2. **A multi-document transaction for all-or-nothing across an order.** An order can contain several products. We run all the conditional decrements inside a single Mongoose **transaction** (replica-set session). If any line item fails its `$gte` guard (insufficient stock) or the product doesn't exist, we **abort** — every decrement already applied in that order **rolls back** automatically. This gives the whole order true all-or-nothing semantics without hand-rolled compensation.

**Why both?** The conditional update is the correctness guarantee against overselling (sufficient on its own for a single-product order). The transaction is what makes a **multi-product** order atomic; without it we'd have to manually restore stock for earlier items when a later item fails — error-prone. Using the atomic guard *inside* the transaction combines per-document oversell safety with cross-document atomicity.

**Trade-off vs. the alternative (atomic update only, no transaction).** Atomic-update-only works on a standalone MongoDB (no replica set) and avoids transaction overhead, but needs explicit compensation logic for multi-item orders. We chose transactions because multi-item correctness is clearer and safer, and both MongoDB Atlas and our Docker setup run as replica sets. (Converting between the two is straightforward — a deliberate design point.)

**Edge cases handled.**

- **Duplicate line items** (same product listed twice in one order): quantities are **aggregated** before the stock check/decrement.
- **Insufficient stock:** `409 Conflict`, message identifies the product.
- **Non-existent product:** `404 Not Found`.
- **Invalid quantity** (≤ 0 or non-integer): `400 Bad Request` (rejected at validation).
- **Zero stock:** treated as insufficient for any quantity ≥ 1.

**Data modeling.**

- Order lines **snapshot the price** at purchase time (`priceAtPurchase`) so later price changes don't rewrite order history.
- **Indexes:** unique `user.email`; `product.category` (filtering); `order.user`, `order.status`, `order.createdAt` (own-order lookups, filtering, pagination).

## Testing

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Tests use an **in-memory MongoDB replica set** (`mongodb-memory-server`), so no external database is needed (the MongoDB binary is downloaded once on first run). Coverage includes core CRUD paths, auth/role enforcement, order validation, and a **concurrency test** that fires many simultaneous orders against limited stock and asserts stock is never oversold.

## Security

- **JWT** auth; passwords hashed with bcrypt (via `bcryptjs`).
- **Role-based access control** enforced in middleware, not controllers.
- **helmet** (secure headers), configurable **cors**.
- **express-mongo-sanitize** + careful query construction to blunt NoSQL injection.
- **Rate limiting** on public endpoints.
- **No secrets in the repo** — all config via environment variables.
